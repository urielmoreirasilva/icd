Homeless outreach does drive-bys with tents and  tarps and bags of food, entrenching the vermin. Sidewalks become filled with rotting food and garbage. Streets turn to shit and San Diego becomes San Dighetto. City Hall is useless, totally bereft of ideas. Wait for the Feds to ride to the rescue, we?re told.

It does have a serious lean towards the street and it would be best to remove it. If you would look at it I would greatly appreciate  it.  Thank you. Robert Dean 619-806-7873 robertdean779@gmail.com.

These were picture and you could notice the difference in the cleanup effort.  So now the encampment is closer to Rancho Mission Villas.  This is also right next to the trolley and river so guess where the trash is going to end up.  I saw Homeless Outreach today passing out food.  Stop making it so easy for people to remain in my community.  This is just insane.  People are using drugs in plain sight!
